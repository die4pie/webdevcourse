<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Stars in her eyes tongue full of flies
  Would you like to share my pad?
  </p>

<p>Croak croak croak bullfrog in love
  Croak croak croak bullfrog in love
  And I gave her the croak that meant "I love you"</p>

<p>I’ll be your Croak Monsieur
  I’ll be your Croak Madame
  Your mama might’ve said that bullfrogs are dogs
  But I’m here to tell you that I’m a frog
  Come and sit on my log, you little polliwog
  I find you absolutely ribbiting</p>
